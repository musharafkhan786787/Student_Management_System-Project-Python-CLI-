# Student Directory Management System

## Overview
The **Student Directory Management System** is a Python-based command-line application for managing student records. It allows users to add, modify, delete, and display student information. The data is stored in a CSV file, making it simple to maintain and import/export student records.

## Features

- **Modify Existing Record**: Edit an existing student's information based on their Roll No.
- **Delete Record**: Remove a student's record from the directory using their Roll No.
- **Show All Students**: Display all students' records in a table format.
- **Import from CSV**: Load student data from an external CSV file and view or filter selected columns.

2. Ensure Python is installed (Python 3.x recommended).
